# VSCubing frontend - WiP ğŸš§ğŸš§ğŸš§

- This is going to be based on an old version of [vscubing/vscubing-backend](https://github.com/vscubing/vscubing-backend) (550b7ed), until the backend refactoring is at a stage where the backend is fully functional again. 
- Gradual integration with the refactored backend is on the branch [/new-backend-and-api-codegen](https://github.com/vscubing/vscubing-frontend/tree/new-backend-and-api-codegen).
